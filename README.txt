This plugin adds a new panel to manage print layouts directly from QGIS main window. It allows to quickly open, create, rename, delete and filter print layouts without having to open the layout manager. It supports layout templates and also makes it possible to batch export one or multiple layouts to PDF, Image or SVG formats without having to open each print layout.
